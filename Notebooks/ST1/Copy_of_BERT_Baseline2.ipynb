The product is pelleted dry feed, packaged in poly bags featuring \\\"Payback Champion Feeds\\\" on the label.  Initial customer reports indicated potential health issues and fatalities in goats consuming the feed.  Monensin, an FDA-approved feed additive, can cause toxicity in high concentrations. Symptoms observed in goats included bloating, bloody urine, and breathing difficulties, potentially leading to death.  Human exposure can also lead to skin, eye, and respiratory irritation.  The recall is a result of a manufacturing error that led to elevated monensin levels.  The affected feed was held for testing after an initial customer complaint.  CHS Nutrition is working to track down any remaining product and recommends not feeding the affected feed to any animals. For replacement information, please contact Kent Hansen at CHS Nutrition at 800-700-2295 or 541-564-0355 between 8 AM and 4:30 PM PST.\"\n",

Reports of unusual feed consistency and suspected negative impacts on cattle health have led to this precautionary measure. While the exact nature of the issue is being investigated, initial reports suggest some feed tubs are exhibiting an unusual softness, potentially leading to overconsumption and consequent urea toxicity.  This could result in serious health problems or even death in livestock.  Customers in the affected states (Arizona, Arkansas, etc.) are urged to immediately cease feeding this product to their cattle.  The affected batch, manufactured on March 19, 2021, is clearly identified with a specific lot number printed on the feed tub.  Consumers can return the product or dispose of it appropriately.  Further details and contact information for Purina customer service are included below.  Purina Animal Nutrition is committed to the well-being of livestock and is proactively addressing this issue. Affected states include Arizona, Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, and Washington.

Affected products, distributed primarily in Texas and Louisiana, were mislabeled with incorrect ice cream flavors.  Specifically, Rocky Road ice cream pints are packaged with lids and contents of Cookies 'n Cream flavor.  This crucial mislabeling potentially exposes consumers with sensitivities to wheat and soy to these allergens.  The affected pints bear a unique code: 022918576.  Consumers who have purchased this product are advised to return it to their point of purchase for a full refund.

The noodles, sourced from a supermarket in Tsim Sha Tsui, failed to properly label the preservative, sulphur dioxide, on its packaging, despite the product containing the additive.  This incident highlights a critical breach of the Preservatives in Food Regulation.  Consumers are urged to immediately discontinue consumption of the affected batch of Select Shrimp-Egg Noodles from China (454g).  The vendor and distributor have been notified and a recall initiated.  The recall hotline is 2606 8658.  Sulphur dioxide, while permitted in certain foods, must be explicitly listed on product labels to avoid allergic reactions or health complications.   The CFS emphasizes the importance of full compliance with food labelling regulations.  Further investigation into the source and extent of potential product distribution is underway. Penalties for non-compliance are severe and may include fines of up to $50,000 and/or imprisonment for six months.\",\n          \"A major recall has been initiated for batches of 'Zest' Sparkling Pineapple soft drinks due to a significant risk of bottle explosions.
